## Pre-release

The master branch is pre-release and may or may not have been tested yet.

Tests are performed in a virtual environment with a phsyical domain controller;
    Current setup is a Physical Windows Server 2016 TP4
    Clients are virutalised on Hyper-V on a Windows 10 Desktop or
    virtualised on VMWare Fusion on a Mac OS X 10.11 MacBook Pro
    
When this branch has passed testing, documentation "should" be revisited and then uploaded to a new branch.
        "Release-v?"

The Wiki will then be updated with the latest link!
