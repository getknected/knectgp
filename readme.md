## Release 0.5

Version v0.5! 

This is a maintenance release more than anything. There was questions about the Office 2016 settings and when Office 2019 would be supported.

Office 2016 terminology has been updated to identify as Office 2019 and Office 365, this is due to Microsoft not bumping up the version number and have preferred to keep Office at 16.0.x.x.

And thatâ€™s that for v0.5.0!

Quality control is taken seriously at Knect and we test each policy in a mixed client domain, with a Windows Server 2019 Domain Controller and Windows 7 to 10 Clients, sometimes for a laugh we do boot up XP and Vista virtual machines.
