## Release 0.3.0

Release 0.3.0 is has been a big step!

Not only have I crushed some big issues with how I started off KyGP - cough https://github.com/KyIT/KyGP/issues/5

I now have a standardised format in how the policies are now written and how the localisation is done!

Just a quick overview on the definitions in the ADML

Prefix | Description | Explination
------ | ----------- | -----------
C_ | Category Definitions | These are essentially the names of the folder in the Group Policy Admin Pack.
P_ | Policiy Definitions | These are the names of the Policies, i.e. Prevent this from happening.
Su_ | supportedOn Definitions | This is the huge list of Windows Operating Systems that has been cultivated to allow for granular requirement descriptions!

Suffix | Description | Explination
------ | ----------- | -----------
_d | Definition Description | This is the description of the Definition that is selected when browing in the Group Policy Management Editor, for Policies this is what shows up on the right hand side :+1:

So that happened :)

A new policy was also added!

Details are here - https://github.com/KyIT/KyGP/issues/3

And thats that for 0.3! 

For a reference of the Group Policies, please check out the readme.docx.
