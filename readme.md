# KnectGP

## Release 0.5.1

Version v0.5.1!

### Bug Fixes
Quick bug fix over the language for Office 2016 and later, some of the language wasn't showing. Partly because it was being incorrectly referenced as everything had moved since they were initally created. D'oh!

SupportedOn Definitions had an incorrect file name, this can be rectified on ealier builds by renaming `knect-su.admx` > `knectgp-su.admx`

### New Things
You can now configure the default port of Remote Desktop as a Computer Configuration, this can be handy if you are limited to one external IP perhaps and you cannot bind external ports to a different internal port, i.e. 3390 > 3389
